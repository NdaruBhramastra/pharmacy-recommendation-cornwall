# Interactive Pharmacy Recommendation Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves an interactive ArcGIS dashboard for the city of Cornwall, Ontario. The dashboard is designed to assist municipal public health authorities in identifying a candidate neighborhood for funding to support the opening of a new pharmacy.

## Purpose
The dashboard integrates multiple datasets, including census data, the Ontario Marginalization Index, and pharmacy locations, to provide a data-driven recommendation for a new pharmacy location. The analysis considers various demographic and socio-economic factors to ensure the recommendation meets the needs of the local population.

## Geographic Scales
- **Municipal Boundary**: Highlights the boundaries of Cornwall, Ontario.
- **Forward Sortation Area (FSA)**: Represents the first three digits of a postal code and highlights regional divisions within Cornwall.
- **Dissemination Area (DA)**: Represents smaller geographic units composed of adjacent dissemination blocks, providing a more granular level of analysis.

## Data Sources & Variables
### Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg):
The ON-Marg aggregates multiple demographic factors into four dimensions:
- **Households and Dwellings**: Measures types and density of residential accommodations.
- **Material Resources**: Assesses access to basic material needs.
- **Age and Labour Force**: Evaluates the dependency ratio, senior population percentage, and labor force participation.
- **Racialized and Newcomer Populations**: Examines the percentage of recent immigrants and racialized individuals.

#### Weighted ON-Marg Scores (Comparison between Cornwall and Ontario):
- **Material Resources**
  - Global (Ontario): -0.0348
  - Local (Cornwall): 0.9639
- **Age & Labour Force**
  - Global (Ontario): -0.1405
  - Local (Cornwall): 0.6287

### Statistics Canada Census Data:
The following census variables are included:
- **Total Population by Age Group**
- **Population Aged 65 and Older**
- **Total Census Families**
- **Population of Married Couples with Children**
- **Low-Income Status (Ages 16-64)**
- **Population with No Knowledge of English or French**
- **Non-Canadian Citizens**

### Ministry of Health - Pharmacy Locations:
- Extracted pharmacy point locations from the Ministry of Health Service Provider Location File.
- Pharmacies are mapped to visualize accessibility and gaps in service coverage.

## Pharmacy Location Recommendation
### Dissemination Area 35010254 - Northern Cornwall
This dissemination area has a high proportion of senior residents (~5:11 ratio) and a high age and labor marginalization score (247-556). Seniors typically require more medical care, yet there are no pharmacies within walking distance of this area. This lack of accessibility poses a challenge for seniors who may not have access to reliable transportation. Based on the demographic analysis and accessibility factors, this DA is recommended for the establishment of a new pharmacy.
